## Exercise I


a)First line is constant (will always equal 0): O(1)
Second line is 0(n^3) because there are 3 n and they are getting multiplied together.
Last Line is 0(n^2) because there are 2 multiplication of n
Therefore second line is the dominating factor and the code is:
0(n^3)

b) First line is constant. There are 4 nested loops, each one after the first loop depends on the previous one. There for it will be (n * n * n * n). The running time will be O(n^4).
